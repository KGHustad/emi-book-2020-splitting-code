# emi-book-2020-splitting-code
Source code for the chapter "Operator splitting and finite difference schemes for solving the EMI model" from the book "EMI: Cell-based Mathematical Model of Excitable Cells"

The programs in this repository perform simulations of the electrophysiology of cardiac cells using the [EMI model](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2017.00048/full).

Instructions for the Matlab and Python codes can be found in their respective subdirectories.
