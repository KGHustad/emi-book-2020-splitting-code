# emi-book-2020-splitting-code
Source code for "Operator splitting and finite difference schemes for solving the EMI model" from the book "EMI: Cell-based Mathematical Model of Excitable Cells"

The programs in this repository perform simulations of the electrophysiology of cardiac cells using the EMI model.

Instructions for the Matlab and Python codes can be found in their respective subdirectories.
