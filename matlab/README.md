## Requirements
  - [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (2018a and 2019b has been tested)
  
## Usage
There are two main programs:

`run_simulation.m` runs the simulation and stores the result in a file called `solution.mat`.

`make_plot.m` loads the result from `solution.mat`, plots it, and stores the result to the file `ischemia.png`.
